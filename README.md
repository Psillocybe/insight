# GitSense
If you are not familiar with GitSense, you can learn more about it at

http://gitsense.github.io and http://gitsense.bitbucket.org 

If you were just there, and you are here because you want to manually install the GitSense Chrome Extension or if you want to see what makes it tick, then you've come to the right place.  The source code is open sourced and is licensed under the MIT license, so you can do as you please, but be forewarned, the code structure will most likely change in the near future, to make it easier to develop for other browsers, like Firefox.

## Google Chrome Install Instructions

### 1 - Download the source

You can clone this repository or download it.

Once you have the source, go to where you've downloaded/cloned it and look for a directory called **chrome**.  Once you've located it, make a mental note of where it's located, as you'll need this for step 4.

### 2 - Goto the Chrome Extensions Page

The easiest way to get there, is to enter the following in your browser URL:

chrome://extensions

### 3 - Enable Developer Mode

In the Chrome Extensions page, look for the "Developer mode" checkbox, which is near the top of the page.  Check the checkbox beside "Developer mode" to enable developer mode.

### 4 - Load the extension

With the developer mode enabled, you'll find a button called "Load unpacked extensions..." near the top of the page.  Click on it, and select the path to the **chrome** directory that was mentioned in step 1.

If all went as planned, you should find the GitSense Extension in your Chrome Extension page, which means you are now GitSense enabled.  

Below is a very short list of repos that are GitSense ready that you can play around with.
