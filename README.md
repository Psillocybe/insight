## Chrome Install Instructions

### Install from Webstore

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitsense-insight/fgnjcebdincofoebkahonlphjoiinglo

### Install manually

#### 1 - Download the source

You can clone this repository or download it.

Once you have the source, go to where you've downloaded/cloned it and look for a directory called **chrome**.  Once you've located it, make a mental note of where it's located, as you'll need this for step 4.

#### 2 - Goto the Chrome Extensions Page

The easiest way to get there, is to enter the following in your browser URL:

chrome://extensions

#### 3 - Enable Developer Mode

In the Chrome Extensions page, look for the "Developer mode" checkbox, which is near the top of the page.  Check the checkbox beside "Developer mode" to enable developer mode.

#### 4 - Load the extension

With the developer mode enabled, you'll find a button called "Load unpacked extensions..." near the top of the page.  Click on it, and select the path to the **chrome** directory that was mentioned in step 1.

If all went as planned, you should find the GitSense Extension in your Chrome Extension page, which means you are now GitSense enabled.
